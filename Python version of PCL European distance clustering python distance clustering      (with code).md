I used to use C++ version of the Euclidean distance clustering algorithm, but later when I wrote some Python code, I found that there was no library or other people who had written a Python version of this algorithm, so I had to write one myself. 

 I have used this code in my project and have found no problems so far. 

 Previously, I wrote an article analyzing the Euclidean distance clustering of PCL source code: 

 PCL's European-style distance clustering - Zhihu spent a little time today looking at the relevant algorithms and making a simple note. The clustering code is as follows: from paper_1_v0. my_ransac import my_ransac_v5 import numpy as np img_id = 1 #Read your kitti radar data here path = r'D:\ KITTI\ O... https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/75117664 

 Without further ado, just put in the code: 

  ```python
