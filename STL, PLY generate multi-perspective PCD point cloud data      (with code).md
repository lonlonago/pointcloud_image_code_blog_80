 Using PCL to sample from CAD model (stl, ply format) to obtain point cloud (pcd format) 

 Sampling from multiple perspectives, including only one side of the original CAD model from a certain perspective, is more convenient for registration, because the depth cameras we use generally shoot from one perspective 

 Then finally, the point cloud data from multiple angles are mixed into one, and the complete surface point cloud data of the CAD model can be obtained 

 The effect is as shown in the figure, and the code article is finally released:
